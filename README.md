# Capstone-E-commerce
Welcome to Luxe and Charm!
For my store I chose a clothing store. I sell gowns and accesories for special occasions. I included the about us page which describes what we sell and the company logo as an image.
On all pages I added a navigation bar that is link to each specific page. I also added a shopping bag image for the checkout portion.
For the login page I made a form to include the username and password and the remember me checkbox. I inserted the logo for this page as well.
For the registration page I made a form to include the lines to create a profile. I also added buttons for the social media referals.
For the shop page I used the bootstrap cards and inserted images of my products (dresses,jewelry and shoes) I also added a link onto the "add to bag" button that takes you to the checkout page.
For the checkout page added forms for addresses and billing information. I also put a table as sample of what it would look like if something was added to a bag, and checkout button.
The most interesting part of creating the website was using the bootstrap cards and placing them correctly, it was challenging, but I am proud that I was able to understand it
The most challenging part the form spacing, I could not figure out how to center the forms. That is something I will practice on.
